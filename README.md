# OvaCare

A mobile app crafted to empower individuals with PCOS.

## About the project

1. Every 2 out of 10 women suffer from PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome), yet there are hardly any interfaces available to track and reduce it.
2. About 70% of women with PCOS suffer from infertility, complex childbirth, depression, and body image issues.
3. At OVACARE, our primary objective is to empower individuals with PCOS and promote overall menstrual health through personalized recommendations, tracking tools, educational resources, and a supportive community.
4. By addressing the specific needs of individuals with PCOS and providing a holistic approach to menstrual health management, OVACARE aims to improve overall well-being and enhance the quality of life for its users.
5. Further, it aims to increase awareness about feminine disorders like PCOS, which are often ignored due to existing stigma.
6. The application would take user input like ultrasound, cycle dates, sleep cycle, and current diet plan to track the user's PCOS status using a machine learning model.
6. Services include a PCOS tracker, ovulation tracker, fertility tracker, symptom tracker, daily progress report, OVACARE assistant, workout and meal plans, interactive community, and other essentials for free.
7. The premium application aims to provide hassle-free in-app consultation bookings, guided meditation, specialized expert articles, personal health coaches, and much more.
